              My name is Adila. I was born on the 23rd of December 2002. It is a
              good period for people between the ages of 18 and 24 to discover and
              develop themselves. For this reason, I try to deal with a lot of
              things, but there are still things that I cannot keep up with. If I
              need to define myself, I am curious, open to development, love to
              paint, and love to laugh and laugh.

              I study computer science in university but I have a changeable
              character. To be honest, I still haven't chosen which profession to do
              in the future. I just like to research and learn something. I do not
              want to limit myself on any subject. The goal for many people is to
              limit yourself a little for me.
